My passion lies in addressing challenges at the crossroads of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Theoretical Computer Science. I enjoy developing innovative solutions that tackle complex problems and have a meaningful impact.

Currently, I am a sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD), pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic journey so far has given me a strong foundation in algorithms, optimization techniques, and machine learning.

Driven by a passion for discovery, I am constantly exploring new advancements in the field of Computer Science research. I am well versed in Programming languages and discrete mathematics through courses at IIT Delhi. My work spans implementing machine learning models, delving into cryptographic techniques, and exploring stochastic processes and algorithm design, all reflecting my enthusiasm for blending mathematical rigor with cutting-edge problem-solving approaches.

Beyond academics, I have mentored and taught students, both within and beyond my college, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration. My passion for sports keeps me active and disciplined, with chess, hockey, and table tennis being my favorite pursuits. Additionally, I am deeply driven by a commitment to environmental sustainability and aspire to leverage technology in innovative ways to address the challenges of climate change.
